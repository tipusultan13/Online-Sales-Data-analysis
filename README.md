It is very difficult to define an underdeveloped city without having the information of GDP per capita or some other economic measure. However, the graph clearly visualizes the city list where we can see where most of the transactions happened. In the most digitalized cities, people most often have internet. Hence, they are highly likely to order online rather than going to to shop in person.
